I could barely breathe. “You made it. We made it. You both endured enough that
no one would blame you if you danced off into the sunset like Miryam and
Drakon and never bothered with anything else again. But you are bothering—
you’re both still working to make this peace last. Peace, Rhys. We have peace,
and the true kind. Enjoy it—enjoy each other. You paid the debt before it was
ever a debt.”
